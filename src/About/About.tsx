              <p>If you're curious, I'll give you a brief summary, it won't take long, my story is pretty common to many others :) </p>

              <p><b>I was born and live in Italy</b>, a country I adore despite its thousand pros and cons. I was lucky enough to live in Venice for a while - unforgettable! </p>
              <p><b>I'm a software engineer</b>, I studied programming (and more) both in high school and university, but in the end I decided that code would accompany me throughout my career, and it continues to do so.</p>
              <p><b>I'm a videogame enthusiast</b>, or rather, I was, since my kids occupy every other free moment of my day, but I love them all the same, I swear! Perhaps that's exactly why I started being curious about PCs since I was a child, and yes, I'm old enough to remember the sound of the modem when it was turned on.</p>
              <p><b>I have an attraction to stories</b>, of any kind and told through any medium. I'm firmly convinced that this is something that can significantly impact our development and is often underestimated. I could spend hours listening to grandparents telling their stories from when they were young - actually, if you have a grandparent you don't hear from often and don't have time for, give me their number, I'll gladly keep them company.</p>
              <p><b>I'm also passionate about photography</b>, especially documentary photography, for reasons similar to what I mentioned above regarding stories.</p>
              <p>For now, I think that's all - I don't want to bore you further.</p>
              <p>If you're curious about where I've worked, you can ask me for a connection on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-rinaldi-707322b7/">LinkedIn</a>, I'll be happy to accept it.</p>

            <h2>What I Do</h2>
            <p>
              I started as a mobile developer, and I'm continuing as a mobile developer.
              This is because I'm quite a boring person and also because I find this role very satisfying.
              Working with Swift is a pleasure the Apple documentation is well written,
              the impact of the code is immediately visible on screen,
              you can run complex logic in this kind of distributed system,
              and for many other reasons that I'd like to discuss if you ever text me.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
              "Great software isn't just about writing codeâ€”it's about understanding people,
              solving real problems, and creating experiences that truly matter."

            <p>
              I believe in the power of continuous learning and collaboration. The tech industry
              moves fast, and I'm always excited to explore new technologies, contribute to
              open-source projects, and share knowledge with the community.

            <p>
              When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring photography (hence the name "byteshutter"),
              reading about emerging technologies, or contributing to tech communities. I'm also
              passionate about mentoring aspiring developers and helping others navigate their
              journey in tech.
