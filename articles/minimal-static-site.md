# Building a Minimal Static Site

Welcome to this guide on building a minimal static website using HTML, CSS, and TypeScript.

## Why Static Sites?

Static sites are fast, secure, and easy to deploy. They work great for blogs, portfolios, and documentation.

## Example Code

```html
<div>Hello static world!</div>
```

## Adding Images
