*.xcodeproj/*
!*.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
!*.xcworkspace/contents.xcworkspacedata
*.xcuserstate

# Swift Package Manager
.build/
/*.xcodeproj

# SwiftLint
.swiftlint.yml

# Fastlane
fastlane/report.xml
fastlane/Preview.html
fastlane/screenshots
fastlane/test_output

# Code Coverage
*.profdata
*.xccoverage

# Local configuration files
.env
.env.*

## Introduction
Effective version control is the backbone of modern software development, and Git has become the industry standard. For Swift developers, mastering Git is essential for collaborative work, code management, and maintaining a clean project history. This article covers best practices and workflows specifically tailored for Swift projects.

### Branching Strategy

1. **Main Branch**
   - Represents the production-ready state
   - Protected branch (no direct pushes)
   - Only updated via pull requests

2. **Feature Branches**
   - Created for new features or bug fixes
   - Naming convention: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
   - Kept small and focused

### Commit Best Practices

1. **Atomic Commits**
   - Each commit should represent a single logical change
   - Keep commits focused and small
   - Use `git add -p` to stage changes selectively

2. **Meaningful Commit Messages**
   - Use the imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
   - First line should be 50 characters or less
   - Include a blank line between the subject and body
   - Reference issue numbers when applicable

### Advanced Git Techniques

1. **Interactive Rebase**
   - Clean up your commit history before merging
   - Combine related commits with `git rebase -i`
   - Reorder commits for better logical flow

2. **Git Hooks**
   - Automate tasks like running tests or linting
   - Use pre-commit hooks to catch issues early
   - Example: Run SwiftLint before each commit

3. **Git Worktrees**
   - Work on multiple branches simultaneously
   - Keep different features isolated
   - Avoid stashing and switching branches frequently

## Conclusion
Mastering Git is an ongoing journey for any Swift developer. By implementing these best practices, you'll create a more maintainable codebase, enable smoother collaboration with your team, and have better control over your project's history. Remember that while Git is powerful, its true value comes from using it consistently and effectively. Take the time to learn the underlying concepts, not just the commands, and you'll find yourself working more efficiently and confidently with version control in your Swift projects.
